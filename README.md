# Beyond! Health Hack 21: Prediabetes Risk Management

I grouped up with a team of friends to join [B!HH21](https://www.beyondhealthhack.com). In this hackathon, we proposed a solution called Sugar Free to help Singapore combat diabetes. Our solution takes inspiration from Singapore's [TraceTogether](https://www.tracetogether.gov.sg) program, allowing users to easily track their daily macronutrient intake from hawker stalls and coffeeshops through the use of QR codes. I wrote more about our solution and my journey through this short hackathon on my personal website [here](https://www.joshtyf.com/projects/beyond-health-hack-2021).
